			<h4>Q: Why the sky is blue?</h4>
			<p align="justify">A: We have all wondered, at some point, why the sky is blue. Now is the time to find out – after all, someday your kids will probably ask YOU why the sky is blue!
				Ready? The light that comes from the Sun is white.
				That white light is actually a mixture of all colors, but because they are mixed up we don’t see the separate colors just the white sunlight.
				As the sun’s light passes through our atmosphere, the light becomes scattered by all the air and particles such smog and dust.
				The part of the sunlight that gets scattered the most is the blue part.
				That means that the blue gets separated from the other colors and we get a blue sky!
				At sunset or sunrise, the sun is at a very low angle, so the rays pass through even more molecules and particles.
				This scatters the light even more, separating red, orange and yellow from the white light.
				The more particles, the more scattering.</p>

			<h4>Q: Is a tomato a fruit or a vegetable?</h4>
			<p align="justify">A: To really figure out if a tomato is a fruit or vegetable, you need to know what makes a fruit a fruit, and a vegetable a vegetable.
				The big question to ask is, DOES IT HAVE SEEDS? If the answer is yes, then technically, (botanically) you have a FRUIT.
				This, of course, makes your tomato a fruit. It also makes cucumbers, squash, green beans and pumpkins all fruits as well.
				Along with the fruit from a plant or tree, we can often eat the leaves (lettuce,) stems (celery,) roots (carrots,) and flowers (broccoli). Many of these other parts of the plant are typically referred to as VEGETABLES.
				Now don’t go looking for tomatoes next to the oranges in your grocery stores; fruits like tomatoes and green beans are usually (alas, incorrectly) referred to as “vegetables” in most grocery stores and cookbooks.
				Did you know… A tomato is the official “vegetable” of New Jersey and the official fruit (and vegetable) of Arkansas.</p>

			<h4>Q: What is the most poisonous animal in the world?</h4>
			<p align="justify">A: "Poisonous animals" applies to animals that make you sick if you were to eat them. They may also use their poison as a defense against predators. Venomous animals generally use their venom to stun or kill other animals through a bite or sting.
				Despite what you may have heard, the “Daddy Long Legs” spider is NOT the most venomous animal at all. Some types are non-venomous and others have very little venom – and they are not even spiders!
				So what is the most poisonous animal? That title goes to the poison arrow frogs of the rain forest. A drop of their venom the size of a pin head could kill a human.
				Just holding them is taking a risk on your life. Luckily, they have bright colors to alert you to their venomous status.
				By the way, when it comes to VENOM, the Blue Ring Octopus is often considered the most venomous.</p>

			<h4>Q: What would a compass point to if you were at the North Pole?</h4>
			<p align="justify">A: Believe it or not, there are actually TWO North Poles – the one at the top of the earth and what is known as MAGNETIC NORTH. Magnetic north is actually in northern Canada, and that is where compasses point to.
				Now, on to your question…if you were standing exactly on top of the magnetic north pole, your compass would point nowhere in particular since the place it is used to pointing to is at your feet!
				You should know that finding magnetic north is not always easy – the spot is actually moving about 10 miles northwest every year. Since it was discovered in 1831, magnetic north has traveled many miles from its original spot!</p>

			<h4>Q: What is the largest insect in the world?</h4>
			<p align="justify">A: If you are creeped out by bugs, brace yourself. Insects can get pretty big, but what is the largest insect in the world? “Largest” is a relative term. A mouse is large to a flea, but not to a giraffe.
				So there are several different ways of measuring the size of an insect, most people would consider the largest insect to be the bulkiest and in this case the champion insect is the Acteaeom Beetle or Rhinoceros Beetle (Megasoma actaeon) from South Americ.
				The male beetles can be 9cms long by 5cms wide by 4cms thick…that’s one bulky bug!</p>

			<h4>Q: Why do we cry when we chop onions?</h4>
			<p align="justify">A: Ever cut an onion and started tearing up? Most people do. It turns out when you cut an onion, it releases a gas called, ready for this, Propanethiol S-oxide.
				When mixed with certain enzymes in the onion, it creates a sulfur gas. These gases then get to your eyes and create a mild acid which irritates the eyes.
				Normally, your body would signal you to close your eyes. This, of course, is not a good idea if you are cutting an onion. The next best thing your eyes can do is to make tears to protect the eyes.
				Rubbing your eyes is a bad idea, since your hands are likely full of the tear making onion juice. So how do you keep from tearing up? There are many theories out there.
				I’ve heard some have had luck burning a candle near the chopping site. (Don’t try that without an adult). Wearing safety goggles, however, should reduce the tears every time.</p>

			<h4>Q: What is the difference between a frog and a toad?</h4>
			<p align="justify">A: Frogs and toads are both amphibians and they are similar in many ways, but they are also different in a few ways.
				To be completely accurate, toads are actually a classification of frog. That is to say that, technically, toads are a kind of frog.
				Generally, frogs spend most of their lives in or near water. Toads on the other hand, get out on land a little more and find their way into gardens and yards.
				Frogs also usually have moist slimy skin, while toads have dry bumpy skin. That is usually the best way to tell them apart.
				By the way frog eggs are found in a mass while toad eggs are more in a chain. And, just so you know, toads cannot give you warts.</p>

			<h4>Q: Why can I see the moon during the day?</h4>
			<p align="justify">A: The moon is the brightest object in the night sky. During the day, the sun is much brighter! But sometimes, you can see the moon during the daytime. Why is this?
				The moon is always in the sky. It orbits (travels in a circle) around the earth. The moon looks bright at night because of light from the sun reflecting off the moon’s surface.
				The sun always lights up half of the moon. But we cannot always see that part of the moon – sometimes it is facing away from us. During the day, we can see the moon if it’s a clear day, and the moon is not hiding low in the sky.
				The moon is also easier to see when its orbit brings it closer to earth. Look for the moon in the sky today! If the moon is waning (appearing smaller each night) look for it in the morning, after sunrise.
				If the moon is waxing (appearing bigger each night) look for it in the late afternoon or evening, before sunset. You can’t see the moon during the day if it is a full moon (big and bright) or a new moon (you don’t see any light).</p>

			<h4>Q: Why and how do chameleons change their colors?</h4>
			<p align="justify">A: Many people believe chameleons change colors to disguise themselves and hide from predators. However, chameleons are very fast — many can run up to 21 miles per hour — and can avoid most predators quite easily.
				Camouflage is thus only a secondary reason why most chameleons change color. So why would they want to change colors? Scientists believe that chameleons change color to reflect their moods.
				By doing so, they send social signals to other chameleons. For example, darker colors tend to mean a chameleon is angry. Lighter colors might be used to attract mates.
				Some chameleons also change colors to help their bodies adjust to changes in temperature or light. For example, a chameleon that gets cold might change to a darker color to absorb more heat and warm its body.
				For many years, scientists believed that chameleons change their color by manipulating specialized cells — called chromatophores — that contain different colors of pigment.
				For example, when a chameleon wants to convey a particular mood or message, its brain sends a message to its chromatophores, which then move pigments around to change the chameleon's color.
				Today, researchers believe that pigments aren't the only mechanism chameleons use to change their colors. While pigments can account for warmer tones, such as greens, they can't explain brighter tones, such as reds and yellows.
				Recent studies have shown that chameleons also have a special layer of cells — called iridophores — under their skin. These special cells, which contain pigment and reflect light, are made up of hundreds of thousands of guanine crystals.
				Chameleons can relax or excite their skin, causing these special cells to move and change structure. Researchers found that, when this happens, these cells act like prisms, reflecting different wavelengths of light to create the variety of tones we see.</p>

			<h4>Q: How are rainbows made?</h4>
			<p align="justify">A: A rainbow is formed when light hits water droplets in the air and is refracted, or bent. Light that appears white (like light from the sun) is actually made up of several colors!
				The colors that make up white light are the same colors that make a rainbow. They are: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. You can often see a rainbow after it rains.
				Beams of sunlight shine towards the rain in the air and when the light goes into the raindrops, it is bent (refracted). When the light bends, it breaks into all of its colors.
				Each color leaves the raindrop at its own angle, different from all the others. The colors of the rainbow always appear in the same order because each color always bends at the same angle.</p>
